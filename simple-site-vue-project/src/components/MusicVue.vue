        <h1>so what do i listen to?</h1>
        <h3>music:</h3>
    <p>well... it depends. Typically when I am trying to focus on something, I work best with "instrumental music" - meaning music without words. I use Spotify for the time being, mainly because of it's algorithms, playlists, and discovery features.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As per what type of instrumental music, I really enjoy some classical music. One of my favorite artists is Antonio Vivaldi, and his Four Seasons concertos. I will also listen to some lofi-hip-hop, or generic instrumental music. The main purpose is to channel my thinking towards what I am working on, and ignore everything else. I often fall victim to listening to music with lyrics, and it takes up a decent size of my unconscious mental processing capacity, thus hindering my output. I try to stay away from vocal-based music, because it distracts me from whats important. I also like Joshua Kyan Aalampour, and Shiro</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, I do enjoy a bit of lyrical music from time to time such as 21 Savage, Morgan Wallen, Yungblud, and Dominik Fike. But from a productivity standpoint, it is often of little utility to listen to these artists(besides opening up my mind to creativity), and will only typically listen to these when I am stressed or under the weather. I often find that transitioning between many of the contemporary songs brings me much higher mood swings, which results in my output and energy falling into an unpredictable manner.</p>
