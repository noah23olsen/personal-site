        <h3>podcasts</h3>
        <p>I have a love-hate relationship with podcasts. On one hand, they offer extremely diverse and unique perspectives on the world, presented as long-form content(which is my favorite). While I've made a conscious effort to surround myself with long-form content in 2023, I often have a hard time listening to podcasts. Not because they are difficult to listen to - I could listen to podcasts all day - but because they often pleasure ad-hoc conversations that aren't always thought out very well.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think there is a time and place for podcasts, but I would much rather read a piece of literature, which is often more thought out in excruciating detail. Over the past few years, I am more and more picky about which podcasts warrant my time and front-of-mind, and will typically listen to these to decompress or to expand my worldview. Here are some of the podcasts that I've listened to over the past few years:
            <br>
            -to preface, these are mostly business-related in some manner or another, but the principals can be applied to many different fields imo - especially ambition and critical thinking about the world
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The All In Podcast</b> - (geopolitics, macroeconomics, and often a bunch of pointless conversations... but there are a lot of unique insights here.)</li>
            <li><b>Acquired</b> - details a lot of successful companies/organizations, how they were founded, and how they got to where they are today</li>
            <li><b>Founders Podcast</b> - author reads a biography of a famous individual in history, then talks about how they lived their life, and often practical applications you can carry over to your own life.
            <br>
            -my main takeaway from this podcast, is to be relentlessly ambitious, and that the self-made man is achievable in almost all facets, even today.
            </li>
            <li><b>Naval Podcast Series</b> - some techbro guy with some incredible insights into the world.</li>
            <li><b>80,000 hours podcast</b> - utilitarian podcast. I haven't listened to many episodes, but regardless if you agree with hardset utilitarianism, there are a lot of general principles you can apply to your everyday life. There is an episode on SBF, pre-chaos blowup era, but actually led me to respect him quite a bit. However, what someone says in theory is not always what happens practically!</li>
            <li><b>Darknet Diaries</b> - cybersecurity podcast, probably pretty mainstream, but it details some quasi-interesting stories about the "dark net". Aside from this normie term, i've realized holistically from learning about cyberspace how unsecure everything in our world really is... like you could easily cause a lot of chaos if you combine intellect with criminal intent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>audiobooks</h3>
        <p>in progress... but I love audiobooks, and mainly use libby, hoopla, and audible</p>
        <h3>music:</h3>
    <p>For music well... it depends. Typically when I am trying to focus on something, I work best with "instrumental music" - meaning music without words. I use Spotify for the time being, mainly because of it's algorithms, playlists, and discovery features.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As per what type of instrumental music, I really enjoy some classical music. One of my favorite artists is Antonio Vivaldi, and his Four Seasons concertos. I will also listen to some lofi-hip-hop, or generic instrumental music. The main purpose is to channel my thinking towards what I am working on, and ignore everything else. I often fall victim to listening to music with lyrics, and it takes up a decent size of my unconscious mental processing capacity, thus hindering my output. I try to stay away from vocal-based music, because it distracts me from whats important. I also like Joshua Kyan Aalampour, and Shiro</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, I do enjoy a bit of lyrical music from time to time such as 21 Savage, Morgan Wallen, Yungblud, and Dominik Fike. But from a productivity standpoint, it is often of little utility to listen to these artists(besides opening up my mind to creativity), and will only typically listen to these when I am stressed or under the weather. I often find that transitioning between many of the contemporary songs brings me much higher mood swings, which results in my output and energy falling into an unpredictable manner.</p>
